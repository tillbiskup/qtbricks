*Python Qt components: widgets and utils, focussing on scientific GUIs.*

Welcome! This is qtbricks, a Python package collecting a growing series of "real-world" **GUI widgets** and related tools written with and for **PySide6**, the official Python bindings for Qt6.

Do you want or need to create complex GUIs with Python and Qt but don't want to spend too much time reimplementing seemingly basic widgets and functionality? Are you overwhelmed by the complexity of GUI programming and just want to focus on the actual tasks that need to get done? So do we, and that's how qtbricks was born. **Separate the GUI from the business logic** in your code, provide a series of high-level GUI widgets for (admittedly complex) standard tasks, **focus on as readable and as Pythonic code as possible**. And yes, it has a clear focus on **GUIs for scientific data analysis** tasks.


Features
========

A list of features:

* Highly modular code: each widget is as self-contained as possible

* User-friendly: obvious behaviour, no surprises, hints (via tooltips) included

* Separation of concerns: widgets handle the GUI stuff and expose a programmatic API

* Designed with code readability in mind


And to make it even more convenient for users and future-proof:

* Open source project written in Python (>= 3.7)

* Developed fully test-driven (well, not yet...)

* Extensive user and API documentation


Installation
============

To install the qtbricks package on your computer (sensibly within a Python virtual environment), open a terminal (activate your virtual environment), and type in the following::

    pip install qtbricks

A note on the name
==================

Why "qtbricks"? What is in a name? A name should answer the important questions (What is it? What does it?), should be easy to remember and reasonably unique to be searchable (findable!) on the web. Bricks are basic building blocks, more generic than the term "widget" in a GUI context, and after all, bricks seem to have a natural connection to windows, haven't they?
