Main GUI window.

There is usually one main window of a GUI, and this window consists of all
the default parts provided by the Qt framework, namely menu bar and toolbars
at the top, status bar at the bottom, and areas for dockable windows/widgets
on all four sides of the central widget.

While the actual contents of both, the central widget and the dock areas
and the other components are more or less unique for your application,
a main window of a GUI comes with a lot of features and basic
functionality that are rather general. Hence you can greatly reduce the
amount of code to write when inheriting from the :class:`MainWindow` class
implemented here.

.. note::

    Some ideas are borrowed and adapted from Mark Summerfield and his
    excellent book "Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt" (Prentice
    Hall, Upper Saddle River, 2008). While written for Python 2 and PyQt4,
    both the concepts and the thorough introduction to GUI programming are
    probably still the best that is available for creating GUIs with
    Python and Qt.


How to call and where to instantiate
====================================

Rather than creating an instance of :class:`MainWindow` yourself, you will
usually call the :func:`app.main` function of the :mod:`app` module,
or simply call the GUI by means of the respective gui_scripts entry point
defined in ``setup.py``.

An example of an :mod:`app` module is shown below:

.. code-block::

    import sys

    from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication
    from PySide6.QtGui import QIcon

    from qtbricks import mainwindow, utils


    def main():
        app = QApplication(sys.argv)
        app.setOrganizationName("demoapp")
        app.setOrganizationDomain("example.org")
        app.setApplicationName("Demo application")
        app.setWindowIcon(QIcon(utils.image_path("icon.svg")))

        window = mainwindow.MainWindow()
        window.show()
        app.exec()


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()


Note that the setting of the organisation name
(``app.setOrganizationName()``) is crucial for storing settings, as this
determines the name of the directory the settings are stored under. The
exact location of the configuration depends on your operating system.

The corresponding section in the ``setup.py`` file with the gui entrypoint
may look similar to the following:

.. code-block::

    setuptools.setup(
        # ...
        entry_points={
            "gui_scripts": [
                "demoapp = demoapp.gui.app:main"
            ]
        },
        # ...


In this particular case, both, your package and the respective GUI
entrypoint, *i.e.* the callable from the terminal, are named "demoapp". Of
course, you will need to change this to some sensible name for your
package/GUI application.


Some notes for developers
=========================

GUI programming can be quite complex, and the :class:`MainWindow` class
provides only a small set of (sensible) defaults for the most common tasks.
However, to help with creating GUIs and to keep the code as readable as
possible, some general advice and an overview of the functionality
implemented are given below.


Saving and restoring GUI settings
---------------------------------

By default, window geometry and state will be saved on close and restored on
startup. This creates a file, typically in the user's home directory,
and depending on the respective platform. Directory and file name depend on
the settings of organisation and application name on the application level.
For details, see the :func:`app.main` function in the :mod:`app` module.

To this end, a private method :meth:`MainWindow._restore_settings` gets
called from the constructor to restore the settings, and the
:meth.`MainWindow.closeEvent` method is overridden to take care of saving
the current settings on closing the GUI.


Adding menus
------------

Menus (and toolbars) are essential aspects of nearly every GUI, particular
the main window. In its default configuration, three menus are created:
"File", "View", and "Help". The "File" menu is populated with a "Quit"
action and associated keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + Q", the "Help" menu with an
"About" action and associated keyboard shortcut "F1". The "View" menu is a
reminder that in case of dockable windows, you need a way to restore windows
closed by the user.

While the :meth:`MainWindow._create_menus` method gets called from the
:meth:`MainWindow._setup_ui` method on startup, for the sake of code
readability it is best to separate creating each menu into its own (private)
method that gets called in turn from within the
:meth:`MainWindow._create_menus` method.

Each (active) entry in a menu is an action in Qt speak, and to help with
adding those actions, there is a (private) method
:meth:`MainWindow._create_action` taking a series of parameters. Perhaps it
is best explained with an example:


.. code-block::

    file_quit_action = self._create_action(
        "&Quit",
        self.close,
        QtGui.QKeySequence.Quit or "Ctrl+Q",
        "file_quit",
        "Close the application"
    )


Here, we define the action for quitting the main window and hence the entire
GUI application. The first argument is the text appearing in the menu,
including the keyboard accelerator character. The second argument is the
actual method being called, followed by the keyboard shortcut, a name for an
icon file (entirely optional), and finally an explaining text used as
tooltip in case of a toolbar and shown in the status bar in case of a menu.

Qt actions are defined once and can be used in different contexts: You can
add them to a menu, to a context menu, and to a toolbar. Depending on your
way of organising your code, you will need to either make the actions
(private) attributes of the :class:`MainWindow` class or define menus,
context menus and toolbars all within one method.

A further convenience method helping to add actions to menus is
:meth:`MainWindow._add_actions`. Here, you can not only provide a list of
actions, but "None" as well that will be converted to separators.


Adding dockable windows
-----------------------

Generally, dockable windows need to inherit from
:class:`PySide6.QtWidgets.QDockWidget`. A prototypical class for a dockable
window is shown below. Adapt to your own needs. Of course, a dockable window
can (and usually will) contain arbitrarily complex widgets.


.. code-block::

    class GeneralDockWindow(QtWidgets.QDockWidget):

        def __init__(self, title="General Dock Window"):
            super().__init__()
            self.setObjectName("GeneralDockWindow")
            self.setWindowTitle(title)
            self.list_widget = QtWidgets.QListWidget()
            self.setWidget(self.list_widget)


The possible docking areas the window can be attached to can be restricted
as well:


.. code-block::

    self.setAllowedAreas(Qt.LeftDockWidgetArea | Qt.RightDockWidgetArea)


To add such a dockable window to your main window, extend the
:meth:`MainWindow._create_dock_windows` method in a way similar to the
following:


.. code-block::

    def _create_dock_windows(self):
        general_dock_window_1 = GeneralDockWindow("general 1")
        self.addDockWidget(Qt.LeftDockWidgetArea, general_dock_window_1)
        self._view_menu.addAction(general_dock_window_1.toggleViewAction())


Important here is to add the action to the View menu in order to be able to
restore a closed dockable window. To make things easier, the same can be
achieved using the convenience function :meth:`MainWindow._add_dock_window`:


.. code-block::

    self._add_dock_window(
        GeneralDockWindow,
        "general 1",
        Qt.LeftDockWidgetArea
    )


In case you want to layout two or more dock widgets as tabbed windows,
use the same method, but assign the output to a variable of your choosing,
and afterwards programmatically "tabify" the respective docked windows:


.. code-block::

    dock1 = self._add_dock_window(...)
    dock2 = self._add_dock_window(...)
    self.tabifyDockWidget(dock1, dock2)


Just make sure that both windows you want to appear in tabs are set to the
same docking area. Otherwise, the first one will "win" and drag the second
one to the same docking area.


Preventing loss of work on closing the GUI
------------------------------------------

As soon as the user can change contents from within the GUI, it may no
longer be safe to simply close the window and hence quit the entire
application. The same is true for changes that need to be applied or
discarded before switching to some other dataset or else. To detect (and
handle) the situation when changes are present that have not yet been saved,
reimplement the method :meth:`MainWindow._ok_to_continue` according to your
needs. Furthermore, this method allows for convenient and readable code
similar to


.. code-block::

    if self._ok_to_continue():
        ...


For an actual example, you may have a look at the
:meth:`MainWindow.closeEvent` method.
