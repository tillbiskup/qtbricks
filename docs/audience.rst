Who is the target audience of the qtbricks package? Is it interesting for me?

Qtbricks mainly addresses scientists forced to write GUIs for their Python code, but at least some of the widgets and tools provided should be useful for a much broader and general audience.

People caring about modular, readable, maintainable code will probably take the most advantage from the widgets and tools provided. Ideally, at some point qtbricks allows you to focus nearly entirely on your core business logic (be it data exploration or analysis or else) and a high-level view of a GUI for a more user-friendly access to all the great code you've written.

Eventually, creating GUIs should mostly be plumming together different (arbitrarily complex) widgets with clearly defined behaviour, such as a file browser for exploring your data, a plot area graphically displaying the selected data, and a property editor allowing you and the users of your GUI to conveniently review and change all the parameters of the individual processing and analysis steps.
