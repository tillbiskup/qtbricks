People behind qtbricks
======================

Who are the people behind the qtbricks package?

The qtbricks package is developed by `Till Biskup <https://www.till-biskup.de/>`_, a scientist working in the field of spectroscopy who actively develops a series of Python packages for the processing and analysis of spectroscopic data, most prominently the `ASpecD framework <https://docs.aspecd.de/>`_ and a series of packages derived from this package and dedicated to work with `cw-EPR <https://docs.cwepr.de>`_, `tr-EPR <https://docs.trepr.de>`_, and `UV-vis <https://docs.uvvispy.de>`_ data.

His main focus with these packages is on ensuring `reproducible research <https://www.reproducible-research.de/>`_, something still sadly not really taken seriously in the community nor worked towards.

The qtbricks package was created to facilitate development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for his scientific software packages.
