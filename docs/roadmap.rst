Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.1
===============

* File browser widget

* Plot widget

* Main window with basic functionality

  * Modularise save/restore settings, easily allow to add settings in subclasses
  * Modularise Help->About window


For later versions
==================

* Property editor widget

* Help window with help texts generated via Sphinx and displayed as HTML with links

* General utils and programming advice for GUIs with PySide6


Todos
=====

A list of todos, extracted from the code and documentation itself, and only meant as convenience for the main developers. Ideally, this list will be empty at some point.
